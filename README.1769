Intial development was done against the "PCE" text published by Matthew
Verschuur.  This approach was abandoned in favour of the 1769 text from
textusreceptusbibles.com, as the PCE text appears to have some tendentious
capitalisation, in accordance with Pentecostal doctrine, explained at
https://bibleprotector.com/GUIDE_TO_PCE.pdf

wdiff made a great comparison of textusreceptusbibles against PCE, and 10 verses
with errata were identified (listed in 1769.errata), specifically -
    Genesis 6:5
    Deuteronomy 19:14
    Psalms 137:7
    Psalms 141:1
    2 Kings 25:12 
    1 Chronicles 27:1
    Daniel 7:9
    Matthew 15:26 
    Matthew 17:15
    Matthew 18:17

Variations in the "PCE":
 * Spelling diffences
 * Enquire rendered as "inquire"
 * Capitalisation of "son of David"
 * Many variations in capitalisation of "spirit"
 * A lot more italicised words
 * Some improved punctuation (but punctuation in Jeremiah 32:5 is wrong)

The verses that were found to have typos were replaced with the verses from the
PCE edition.  1769.py reads 1769.txt, 1769.errata and 1769.titles and produces
1769.fix, which has Psalm titles and epistle postscripts.

The following rules were used for choosing errata:
 * Where differences in italics appear, the italics from the 1769 are used.  
 * Where differences in spelling appear, the spelling from the 1769 is used.  
 * Where extra text or missing text occur, the correct verse is substituted from the PCE
 * For capitalisation (except for GOD and LORD), the 1769 is accepted (e.g. son of David)
 * The sources for evaluating the differences were the SA Bible society KJV and the 1611 original edition PDF from princeton university
 * Epistle titles and Psalm titles are copied from the PCE edition
