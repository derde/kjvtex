KERNING

do not kern trailing question mark (it over-loves lower case y - y?)
-- done, I think - only kern A-Za-z to a-z,.;:


END-OF-PAGE CHAPTERS

Chapters that start on the last line of the page are generally deferred to the
following page.  That's nice: but sometimes not appropriate.  The alternative
is to raise the drop cap into the previous line, instead of dropping it.

This manual hack to .tex is a modification to en.tex that makes and end-of-page
one-line chapter start, with the drop-caps ascending into the previous line --

\parfillskip=0pt plus 1pt\relax%
 \verse{25\versehskipa}{18}\biblnewreference{JOB 24:25}{18}%
And if {\em it be} not {\em so} now, who will make me a liar, and
\bibldropcapschapter{25}%
make my speech nothing worth?\biblendreference{JOB 24:25}{18}
\ifdefined\biblendchapterjobxxiv{\biblendchapterjobxxiv}\fi%
\biblendchapter{Job 24}{18}%
\biblnewchapter{Job 25}%
\bibleparnoindent\verse{1\versehskip}{18}%
\biblnewreference{JOB 25:1}{18}Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,\biblendreference{JOB 25:1}{18}

This might be possible to automate using end-of-paragraph indentation, and a multi-pass system --
