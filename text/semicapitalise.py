# Lowercase unnecessary leading capitals
# Rule 1: Find all proper nouns
# Rule 2: Find lines ending in continuation sentences
# Rule 3: If not in the list of proper nouns, then lowercase it

# Exception to the rule - this is a quote, followed by narrative -
# Genesis 28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to
# Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave
# him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;
# Genesis 28:9 [-then-] {+Then+} went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the
# wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister
# of Nebajoth, to be his wife.
